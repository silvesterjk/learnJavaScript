1. React is state driven.
2. State --> Render --> UI --> Update State --> Re-render --> UI
3. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
4. React reacts to state changes and updates the UI.
5. React is not a framework, it is a library. It is not a complete solution and it is not opinionated.
6. For example React does not provide a way to make HTTP requests, it does not provide a way to manage state, it does not provide a way to manage routing.
7. You need external libraries to do these things. Such as Axios for HTTP requests, Redux for state management, React Router for routing.
8. We can alternatively use Next.js or Remix for a more opinionated solution.
9. React is a component based library. Everything in React is a component. They are reusable and composable.
10. React components are written in JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript.
11. JSX is not a requirement for React, but it is recommended.
12. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML.
