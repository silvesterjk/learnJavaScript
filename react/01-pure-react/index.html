<!-- 
  1. React is state driven. It uses virtual DOM to update the UI efficiently.
  2. State --> Render --> UI --> Update State --> Re-render --> UI
  3. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  4. React reacts to state changes and updates the UI. 
  5. React is not a framework, it is a library. It is not a complete solution and it is not opinionated.
  6. For example React does not provide a way to make HTTP requests, it does not provide a way to manage state, it does not provide a way to manage routing.
  7. You need external libraries to do these things. Such as Axios for HTTP requests, Redux for state management, React Router for routing.
  8. We can alternatively use Next.js or Remix for a more opinionated solution.
  9. React is a component based library. Everything in React is a component. They are reusable and composable.
  10. React components are written in JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript.
  11. JSX is not a requirement for React, but it is recommended.
  12. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML.
  13. JSX is a syntax sugar for React.createElement(component, props, ...children).
  14. JSX is compiled to React.createElement calls.
  15. React components can be functional or class based.
  16. Functional components are simpler and easier to read.
  17. Class components have more features and are more powerful.
  18. React components can have state and props.
  19. State is mutable and can be changed. Props are immutable and cannot be changed.
  20. React components can have lifecycle methods. 
  21. Lifecycle methods are methods that are called at different stages of a component's life. For example, when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.
  22. React components can have event handlers. 
  23. Event handlers are functions that are called when an event occurs. For example, when a user clicks a button or when a user types in a text field.
